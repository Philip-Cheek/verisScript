A spokesman for the NHS Trust hospital said it is \"investigating the breach... in accordance with our policies and procedures, \"but security experts warn that staff credentials could be being sold online for \"dollars each\".  De Vere discovered the breach following research into the Lizard Stresser hack last year. He started researching Lizard Squad after the hacktivist group's Christmas Day 2014 DDoS attacks against Sony's PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live. De Vere signed up for a Lizard Stressor demo account with a spam email address to find out more.  Later, when the Lizard Stresser database, containing numerous customer email addresses, was compromised and published at the start of this year, he soon found he was on the receiving end of promotional emails from Russian hacking group 'Horux'.  Horux's website boasts of being \"private information sellers and underground kings\" and it sells everything from readily-available hacking tools to credit card details. \"We sell every tool that exists on the black market, our prices are reasonable and cheap,\" read one email from the group.  On this occasion, it appears to have accessed the email addresses leaked from Lizard Stresser and targeted them with promotional emails  perhaps assuming that all the names on this Lizard Stresser list were 'black hat' hackers.  Crucially, however, De Vere noticed these emails were being digitally signed by Kettering General Hospital  a strong sign that the hospital's email has been compromised. He believes that the hackers did this to avoid email spam filters. The emails appear to have been sent by a VPS server, hosted by Indian hosting company shocksrv, and then authenticated by the email server at the hospital.  De Vere explained how the attackers work. \"The group hack an organisation, gather what they want, then use the hacked email servers to forward these promotional offers,\" he said.  The email server would be \"at the attackers perusal\", further suggesting that \"the same credentials to be able to send mail from these servers could also be used to authenticate email accounts\".  With his knowledge of the Horux group, he added that staff email credentials would likely be sold on the black market for \"dollars each\" and suggested that the breach may well go beyond email at the hospital.  Most likely, the initial intrusion into the hospital servers would have been through a brute force attack against the email servers, or via credentials that were gathering as part of an ongoing phishing campaign.  Sources with close connections to the hospital have confirmed the security breach to our reporter, with some suggesting that the issue was \"swept under the carpet\" by senior executives at the hospital. It took two weeks for the hospital to acknowledge they were investigating the issue.  Infosec resources are also said to be tight at the organisation, which has around 3,000 staff.  Last week, the organisation advertised for an IM&T training manager to manage data quality and ensure \"information collection and recording is of the highest quality\".  The incident has been reported to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) which confirmed it is looking into the issue. \"We have received a complaint about Kettering Hospital and are making enquiries,\" a spokesperson said.  A spokesman for Kettering General Hospital said: \"The Trust has been made aware of an allegation that its IT security has been breached. We take this very seriously and are currently investigating the matter.\" Requests for further information were declined and it is not clear whether personal information has been revealed, why the investigation has taken so long and whether the hospital had informed its staff.  Sarah Clarke, owner of the Infospectives Ltd Security GRC Consultancy, said considering the financial constraints in the public sector, she was not \"hugely surprised\" at the news.  She also said there were several unanswered questions regarding the breach. \"There could be so many reasons for a breach like this. How far 'in' this goes will be key. Is it limited to email servers? If not, what is the breadth and depth of compromise across their network? Has patient data been impacted?\" she told SC.  Clarke added that if the hospital was running its own email or DNS infrastructure, this could \"equate to painting a big red target on your business\".  She believes organisations will ultimately be judged on their response to data breaches. \"With breaches, as with any problems, how you deal with it is just as important as the fact it happened  don't skimp on planning an effective response no matter how secure you think you are. If PR-related panic and bureaucracy trumps prompt investigation and notification, it can be a dramatic own goal. I hope that's not the case here and, if it is, I hope staff or patients don't pay with their personal and financial security.\"","timeline":{"incident":{"month":8,"year":2015}},"victim":{"country":["GB"],"employee_count":"1001 to 10000","industry":"622110","region":["150154"],"victim_id":"Kettering General Hospital"}},{"action":{"hacking":{"variety":["Unknown"],"vector":["Web application"]}},"actor":{"external":{"country":["Unknown"],"motive":["Ideology"],"region":["000000"],"variety":["Unknown"]}},"asset":{"assets":[{"variety":"S - Web application"}]},"attribute":{"confidentiality":{"data_disclosure":"Yes"}},"discovery_method":"Unknown","incident_id":"0199FEF0-3636-4F0F-8A7B-6082E2774DB5","plus":{"analysis_status":"First pass","created":"2013-09-10T20:13:32Z","master_id":"0199FEF0-3636-4F0F-8A7B-6082E2774DB5","modified":"2014-04-27T19:37:01Z","timeline":{"notification":{"day":30,"month":1,"year":2013}}},"reference":"http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/31/tech/china-nyt-hacking/index.html, http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/technology/chinese-hackers-infiltrate-new-york-times-computers.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&_r=0, http://www.zdnet.com/cn/new-york-times-breached-by-chinese-hackers-over-four-months-7000010604/,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/technology/chinese-hackers-infiltrate-new-york-times-computers.html?hp&_r=1&","schema_version":"1.3.1","security_incident":"Confirmed","source_id":"vcdb","summary":"The New York Times' computer system was hacked after Chinese government officials warned the Times about consequences for investigating the wealth of government family members.

The 53 employees were located outside of the United States and appear to have been the ones who may have covered the Chinese stories.","timeline":{"incident":{"month":1,"year":2013}},"victim":{"country":["US"],"employee_count":"1001 to 10000","industry":"511110","region":["019021"],"secondary":{"amount":1,"victim_id":["Wall Street Journal"]},"state":"NY","victim_id":"New York Times"}},{"action":{"hacking":{"variety":["DoS"],"vector":["Web application"]}},"actor":{"external":{"country":["Unknown"],"motive":["Unknown"],"notes":"unknown","region":["000000"],"variety":["Unknown"]}},"asset":{"assets":[{"variety":"S - Web application"}]},"attribute":{"availability":{"variety":["Interruption"]}},"discovery_method":"Unknown","impact":{"overall_rating":"Unknown"},"incident_id":"02275CD0-F49C-4C4F-9071-C93C30F36856","plus":{"analysis_status":"First pass","analyst":"dhylender","created":"2013-10-18T18:28:00Z","github":"620","master_id":"02275CD0-F49C-4C4F-9071-C93C30F36856","modified":"2014-05-10T19:23:22Z","timeline":{"notification":{"day":18,"month":10,"year":2013}}},"reference":"http://news.softpedia.com/news/Russia-s-Central-Bank-and-Other-Financial-Institutions-Hit-by-DDOS-Attacks-392528.shtml","schema_version":"1.3.1","security_incident":"Confirmed","source_id":"vcdb","summary":"The websites of several major Russian financial institutions have been disrupted earlier this month with distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks.","timeline":{"incident":{"month":10,"year":2013}},"victim":{"country":["RU"],"employee_count":"50001 to 100000","industry":"521110","region":["150151"],"victim_id":"RU The Central Bank of the Russian Federation"}},{"action":{"hacking":{"variety":["Unknown"],"vector":["Unknown"]}},"actor":{"external":{"country":["CN"],"motive":["Espionage"],"region":["142030","019021"],"variety":["State-affiliated"]}},"asset":{"assets":[{"variety":"S - File"}]},"attribute":{"availability":{"variety":["Loss"]},"confidentiality":{"data":[{"variety":"Internal"}],"data_disclosure":"Yes","data_victim":["Other"],"state":["Stored unencrypted"]}},"discovery_method":"Unknown","impact":{"overall_rating":"Unknown"},"incident_id":"022CCB00-CE98-4DEF-8B89-18C5A20335F4","plus":{"analysis_status":"First pass","analyst":"gdbassett","attribute":{"confidentiality":{"credit_monitoring":"U"}},"created":"2014-11-20T15:34:00Z","github":"3368","master_id":"022CCB00-CE98-4DEF-8B89-18C5A20335F4","modified":"2014-11-20T15:34:00Z","timeline":{"notification":{"day":10,"month":9,"year":2012}}},"reference":"http://o.canada.com/news/national/telvent-client-alerted-feds-to-hack-at-energy-company-documents-suggest;http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/29/us-hacking-energy-idUSBRE88S01B20120929;http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/09/chinese-hackers-blamed-for-intrusion-at-energy-industry-giant-telvent/;http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/09/28/calgary-telvent-security--hacking-chinese_n_1924078.html","schema_version":"1.3.1","security_incident":"Confirmed","source_id":"vcdb","summary":"Canadian officials confirmed Friday they are aware hackers have breached security at a Calgary-based software manufacturer - one whose products are often used by large energy companies.  According to security news site krebsonsecurity.com, Telvent Canada Ltd. sent letters to their customers last week after it learned of a breach of its internal firewall and security systems on Sept. 10.  \"In order to be able to continue to provide remote support services to our customers in a secure manner, we have established new procedures to be followed until such time as we are sure that there are not further intrusions into the Telvent network and that all virus or malware files have been eliminated,\" the company said in the letter.   \"Although we do not have any reason to believe that the intruder(s) acquired any information that would enable them to gain access to a customer system or that any of the compromised computers have been connected to a customer system, as a further precautionary measure, we indefinitely terminated any customer system access by Telvent.\"  It is believed that a Chinese hacking group may be to blame for the intrusion, which affected customers in Canada, the United States and Spain, said krebsonsecurity.com, citing experts who were able to identify digital fingerprints that point to Chinese hackers.  However, public safety ministry spokesman Jen-Paul Duval would not confirm if a Chinese group was to blame.  \"The Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre is aware of this incident and is already working with stakeholders in government and the private sector,\" he said in an email to the Calgary Herald.  \"We can tell you that the government of Canada is working to protect Canada's cyber networks, identify vulnerabilities and intrusions, and to defend against malicious cyber activity.\"  According to Sun News Network, Telvent's IT services help manage 60% of all oil and gas pipelines in North America and Latin America.  According to The Times Of India, this breach is the latest in a string of hacks targeting the energy sector. Symantec and McAfee have identified similar attacks originating in China.  Joe Weiss, a cyber attack consultant, told Reuters that while vendors often experience connection hacking from customer support sites, most breaches go unreported.  It is not clear how the Telvent breach is affecting customers at this point, but the Calgary Herald reports that if a Chinese group is being the attacks it could make things difficult for the Conservative government, which is now deliberating whether to approve a $15.1 billion bid by Chinese company CNOOC Ltd. for oil company Nexen. Some legislators are unsure of the proposed takeover because of what they believe to be unfair business practices on China's behalf.  \"Canadians just don't want to take this seriously,\" Brian Adams, a former Canadian diplomat who specializes in Chinese crime and espionage told Sun News Network. \"In essence, it's an electronic war that's going on. And this company is bringing to our attention that China could shut down the energy resources of any country in the world with this sort of thing going on.\"","timeline":{"containment":{"unit":"Months"},"discovery":{"unit":"Months"},"incident":{"month":6,"year":2012}},"victim":{"country":["CA"],"employee_count":"101 to 1000","industry":"541511","locations_affected":1,"region":["021000","019021"],"victim_id":"Telvent Canada Ltd"}},{"action":{"hacking":{"variety":["Unknown"],"vector":["Web application"]}},"actor":{"external":{"country":["Unknown"],"motive":["Unknown"],"region":["000000"],"variety":["Unknown"]}},"asset":{"assets":[{"variety":"S - Web application"}]},"attribute":{"confidentiality":{"data":[{"amount":1000,"variety":"Personal"}],"data_disclosure":"Potentially","data_total":1000,"data_victim":["Employee"],"state":["Stored"]}},"discovery_method":"Int - reported by employee","discovery_notes":"The attack was discovered by an office secretary in April","impact":{"overall_rating":"Unknown"},"incident_id":"02811E58-2E80-4DBB-B43B-8F4F077C2EFB","plus":{"analysis_status":"Finalized","analyst":"Robert-Topper","attribute":{"confidentiality":{"credit_monitoring":"U"}},"created":"2016-09-19T18:04:00Z","dbir_year":2017,"github":"7851","master_id":"02811E58-2E80-4DBB-B43B-8F4F077C2EFB","modified":"2016-09-19T18:08:00Z","sub_source":"VCDB","timeline":{"notification":{"day":21,"month":6,"year":2016}}},"reference":"http://www.databreaches.net/ny-holley-central-school-district-investigates-possible-hacking/; http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/money/business/2016/06/21/holley-school-district-info-exposed-in-cyber-attack/86174856/","schema_version":"1.3.1","security_incident":"Confirmed","source_id":"vcdb","summary":"school server hacked","timeline":{"incident":{"month":4,"year":2016}},"victim":{"country":["US"],"employee_count":"101 to 1000","industry":"611110","locations_affected":1,"region":["019021"],"state":"NY","victim_id":"Holley Central School District"}},{"action":{"hacking":{"variety":["Abuse of functionality"],"vector":["Web application"]}},"actor":{"external":{"country":["Unknown"],"motive":["Unknown"],"region":["000000"],"variety":["Unknown"]}},"asset":{"assets":[{"variety":"S - Web application"},{"variety":"S - Database"}]},"attribute":{"confidentiality":{"data":[{"amount":4600000,"variety":"Personal"}],"data_disclosure":"Yes","data_total":4600000,"data_victim":["Customer"],"state":["Stored unencrypted"]}},"discovery_method":"Ext - actor disclosure","impact":{"overall_rating":"Unknown"},"incident_id":"02973E91-8604-4813-9506-089E0E053F2F","plus":{"analysis_status":"First pass","analyst":"blackfist","attribute":{"confidentiality":{"credit_monitoring":"U"}},"created":"2014-06-05T14:26:00Z","github":"1202","master_id":"02973E91-8604-4813-9506-089E0E053F2F","modified":"2014-06-05T14:26:00Z","timeline":{"notification":{"day":2,"month":1,"year":2014}}},"reference":"http://www.journalgazette.net/article/20140103/BIZ/301039976/1031/BIZ (20140605);http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/01/greyhats-expose-4-5-million-snapchat-phone-numbers-using-theoretical-hack/ (20140605);http://blog.snapchat.com/post/72013106599/find-friends-abuse (20140605);http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Snapchat-database-hacked-4-6m-user-IDs-phone-nos-leaked/articleshow/28234201.cms?

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid People pass by a T-Mobile store in the Brooklyn borough of New York June 4, 2015. REUTERS/BRENDAN MCDERMID Experian Plc (EXPN.L), the world's biggest consumer credit monitoring firm, on Thursday disclosed a massive data breach that exposed sensitive personal data of some 15 million people who applied for service with T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.N.  Connecticut's attorney general said he will launch an investigation into the breach.  Experian said it discovered the theft of the T-Mobile customer data from one of its servers on Sept. 15. The computer stored information about some 15 million people who had applied for service with telecoms carrier T-Mobile during the prior two years, Experian said.  T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere said the data included names, addresses, birth dates, Social Security numbers, drivers license numbers and passport numbers. Such information is coveted by criminals for use in identity theft and other types of fraud.  \"Obviously I am incredibly angry about this data breach and we will institute a thorough review of our relationship with Experian,\" T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere said in a note to customers posted on the company's website. \"But right now my top concern and first focus is assisting any and all consumers affected.\" (t-mo.co/1M4FSSd)  The Experian breach is the latest in a string of massive hacks that have each claimed millions - and sometimes tens of millions - of customer records, including the theft of personnel records from the U.S. government this year, a 2014 breach on JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and a 2013 attack on Target Corp's (TGT.N) cash register systems.  It is also the second massive breach linked to Experian. An attack on an Experian subsidiary that began before Experian purchased it in 2012 exposed the Social Security numbers of 200 million Americans and prompted an investigation by at least four states, including Connecticut.  Experian on Thursday said it had launched an investigation into the new breach and consulted with law enforcement.  The company offered two years of credit monitoring to all affected individuals. People, however, said that they did not want credit protection from a company that had been breached.  Legere responded by promising to seek alternatives.  \"I hear you,\" he said on Twitter. \"I am moving as fast as possible to get an alternate option in place by tomorrow.\"  Experian said the breach did not affect its vast consumer credit database.  Legere said no payment card or banking information was taken.  T-Mobile had nearly 59 million customers as of June 30. A representative for the carrier said that not all 15 million of the affected applicants had opened accounts with T-Mobile.  The telecom carrier's shares were down 1.3 percent in extended trading after closing little changed at $40.13 on the New York Stock Exchange.  In the earlier data breach affecting Experian, a Vietnamese national confessed in U.S. court last year to using a false identity to opening an account with the unit, known as Court Ventures, sometime before Experian purchased it in 2012.  A spokeswoman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said on Thursday that it would investigate the latest attack.  The spokeswoman, Jaclyn Falkowski, declined to elaborate on the T-Mobile incident, but said the investigations of the Court Ventures matter \"is active and ongoing.\"  (In 7th and 16th paragraphs, this version of the story corrects to show that the previous Experian data breach began before Experian purchased the company in 2012, not that it occurred in 2014.)","timeline":{"incident":{"day":15,"month":9,"year":2015}},"victim":{"country":["US"],"employee_count":"10001 to 25000","industry":"561450","region":["019021"],"secondary":{"amount":1,"notes":"exposed sensitive personal data of some 15 million people who applied for service with T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.N.","victim_id":["T-Mobile US"]},"victim_id":"Experian Plc"}},{"action":{"hacking":{"variety":["DoS"],"vector":["Unknown"]}},"actor":{"external":{"country":["Unknown"],"motive":["Unknown"],"region":["142145","000000","019021"],"variety":["Unknown"]}},"asset":{"assets":[{"variety":"Unknown"}]},"attribute":{"availability":{"variety":["Interruption"]}},"discovery_method":"Int - unknown","impact":{"overall_rating":"Unknown"},"incident_id":"02DB61B2-D23A-42CB-A13A-8D2BF784962F","notes":"website was DoS'd and brought down for a while.","plus":{"analysis_status":"First pass","analyst":"dhylender","created":"2014-06-09T12:18:00Z","github":"2305","master_id":"02DB61B2-D23A-42CB-A13A-8D2BF784962F","modified":"2014-06-09T12:18:00Z","timeline":{"notification":{"day":4,"month":6,"year":2014}}},"reference":"https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/news/a/24150033/hackers-target-osce-website/","schema_version":"1.3.1","security_incident":"Confirmed","source_id":"vcdb","summary":"Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe suffered DoS attack on Wednesday.","timeline":{"incident":{"day":4,"month":6,"year":2014}},"victim":{"country":["AT"],"employee_count":"101 to 1000","industry":"813940","region":["150155"],"victim_id":"Operation for Security and Cooperation in Europe"}},{"action":{"hacking":{"variety":["Unknown"],"vector":["Web application"]}},"actor":{"external":{"country":["Unknown"],"motive":["Financial"],"region":["000000"],"variety":["Unknown"]}},"asset":{"assets":[{"variety":"S - Web application"}]},"attribute":{"availability":{"variety":["Loss"]},"confidentiality":{"data":[{"amount":1900000,"variety":"Credentials"}],"data_disclosure":"Yes","data_total":1900000,"data_victim":["Customer"],"state":["Stored"]}},"discovery_method":"Unknown","impact":{"overall_rating":"Unknown"},"incident_id":"02FD07DC-72FC-4953-B68B-55E21D500705","plus":{"analysis_status":"Finalized","analyst":"swidup","attribute":{"confidentiality":{"credit_monitoring":"U","data_misuse":"Y"}},"created":"2017-01-27T22:34:00Z","dbir_year":2017,"github":"8737","master_id":"02FD07DC-72FC-4953-B68B-55E21D500705","modified":"2017-01-27T22:42:00Z","sub_source":"DBIRPRIORITY","timeline":{"notification":{"year":2016}}},"reference":"http://denver.cbslocal.com/2016/11/02/coloradan-apologizes-after-1-9-million-photobucket-accounts-hacked/","schema_version":"1.3.1","security_incident":"Confirmed","source_id":"vcdb","summary":"A 29 month prison sentence was handed down on Tuesday to a Colorado man who pleaded guilty to charges involving a massive photo hacking scheme.

The official statement released by the company claims that only a limited number of Care2 member accounts were accessed by the cybercriminals, but as a precaution measure, all their 17,911,623 account holders are forced to change their passwords on their next log-in.  We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience. Given our large membership size, we have become a significant target for spammers and hackers over the past few years, and this was the first hacking attempt that successfully breached our protective walls, Care2 representatives wrote on the sites blog.  The vulnerabilities which the hackers used to penetrate the sites defenses were immediately patched up to prevent further access, but the incident is still being investigated to determine the full extent of the breach.  The FBI has been contacted to investigate the matter, but so far, the only clues to point to the identity of the attackers are some IP addresses from Russia. This, however, doesnt necessarily prove that the attack was launched from there. It could be that the hackers compromised devices from this certain location.  Since no financial information is stored in the sites databases, the hackers may have targeted Care2 in order to obtain passwords which they can later use to gain access to other accounts, including ones that contain more sensitive data.  This is exactly why customers are advised not only to change their passwords on the breached site, but also on others that share the same credentials. This procedure has to be done in the shortest time since after they get their hands on the loot, the crooks will try to make the best of it before their victims get to do anything about it.

At risk of compromise were customers' user names, passwords, birthdates, email and billing addresses, and partial credit card info. However, the company states that \"there is no evidence\" that full credit card numbers were stolen at this time.  In a message posted on the Trion Worlds website, the company promises that it is both researching the intrusion and taking steps to increase security. As part of this, all RIFT players will be asked to change passwords and security questions, and their mobile authenticators will need to be reconnected.  The company urges customers to watch their bank statements for questionable activity, and provides customers with resources to get a free credit report and putting a freeze on credit reports.  To compensate customers for the issue, Trion is providing all RIFT players with three extra days of gaming time and a Moneybags' Purse that increases all money looted by 10% in-game.","timeline":{"incident":{"month":12,"year":2011}},"victim":{"country":["US"],"employee_count":"101 to 1000","industry":"511210","region":["019021"],"state":"CA","victim_id":"Trion Worlds"}},{"action":{"hacking":{"variety":["Unknown"],"vector":["Web application"]}},"actor":{"external":{"country":["Unknown"],"motive":["Financial"],"region":["000000"],"variety":["Organized crime"]}},"asset":{"assets":[{"variety":"S - Web application"}]},"attribute":{"confidentiality":{"data":[{"variety":"Credentials"},{"variety":"Payment"},{"variety":"Personal"}],"data_disclosure":"Yes","data_victim":["Customer"],"state":["Stored unencrypted"]}},"discovery_method":"Int - IT review","impact":{"loss":[{"rating":"Unknown","variety":"Asset and fraud"},{"rating":"Unknown","variety":"Brand damage"},{"rating":"Unknown","variety":"Business disruption"},{"rating":"Unknown","variety":"Operating costs"},{"rating":"Unknown","variety":"Legal and regulatory"},{"rating":"Unknown","variety":"Competitive advantage"},{"rating":"Unknown","variety":"Response and recovery"}],"overall_rating":"Unknown"},"incident_id":"036335D2-78B1-4348-AFCF-ACE8203AF1CF","plus":{"analysis_status":"First pass","analyst":"blackfist","asset":{"total":"No"},"attribute":{"confidentiality":{"credit_monitoring":"U","data_abuse":"Y"}},"created":"2013-02-15T16:56:39Z","f500":"N","master_id":"036335D2-78B1-4348-AFCF-ACE8203AF1CF","modified":"2014-05-10T00:58:18Z","timeline":{"notification":{"day":24,"month":1,"year":2012}}},"reference":"http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20120125/NEWS/120129865 (20130215) http://blog.al.com/breaking/2012/01/tide_fans_ordering_from_bamast.html (20130215)","schema_version":"1.3.1","security_incident":"Confirmed","source_id":"vcdb","summary":"Hackers breach college bookstore website and stole non-public data","timeline":{"compromise":{"unit":"Unknown"},"containment":{"unit":"Hours"},"discovery":{"unit":"Days"},"exfiltration":{"unit":"Unknown"},"incident":{"day":16,"month":1,"year":2012}},"victim":{"country":["US"],"employee_count":"11 to 100","industry":"451211","notes":"University of Alabama bookstore, bamastuff.com","region":["019021"],"revenue":{"amount":2800000,"iso_currency_code":"USD"},"state":"AL","victim_id":"Alabama Book Store, Inc."}},{"action":{"hacking":{"variety":["Brute force"],"vector":["Unknown"]}},"actor":{"external":{"country":["Unknown"],"motive":["Unknown"],"region":["000000"],"variety":["Unknown"]}},"asset":{"assets":[{"variety":"Unknown"}]},"attribute":{"confidentiality":{"data":[{"variety":"Classified"}],"data_disclosure":"Unknown","data_total":2000000,"data_victim":["Customer"],"notes":"Passwords on to the site was released online for the public.

Gay & Lesbian Center recently learned that the security of certain of our information systems was compromised by a criminal cyber attack apparently designed to collect social security numbers, credit card numbers and other financial information. Between November 22, 2013 and December 3, 2013 our forensic investigators confirmed that this attack potentially exposed certain of your information to unauthorized access and acquisition. I say potentially because, to date, there is no evidence that any information was actually accessed or acquired as a result of this criminal invasion. However, the information potentially exposed may have included your name, contact information, medical or healthcare information, date of birth, credit card information, Social Security number and health insurance account number. Based upon our investigation, the period during which your information may have been exposed appears to have been between September 17, 2013 and November 8, 2013. Out of an abundance of caution, we want to make you aware of the attack and our efforts to help safeguard your information. Immediately upon learning of this criminal attack and the potential exposure of private patient information, the Center took action. Specifically, upon learning of the potential of this incident, we promptly took the following actions: (i) curtailed the intrusion; (ii) hired numerous experts, including two leading national forensic investigation firms, to help us investigate the situation and determine the individuals and information potentially affected; and (iii) began the process of notifying potentially affected individuals. In addition, we have notified law enforcement and are taking steps to further guard against this type of criminal attack in the future. As always, we recommend that you remain vigilant by reviewing your explanation of benefits for medical services and financial account statements, as well as free credit reports for unauthorized activity. From the moment we learned of the potential exposure, our primary concern has been ensuring that you are protected against risks related to this incident. Therefore, we have engaged Experian, one of the leading providers of credit monitoring products, to provide you with its ProtectMyID Alert membership, including credit monitoring, for one year at no cost to you. Enclosed with this letter is information regarding these services and instructions for enrollment, as well as an insert providing additional useful information regarding steps you can take to protect yourself against identity theft. We have also engaged Experian to provide a dedicated call center to answer questions about this incident.

In addition to failing to ensure that only the latest, most secure versions of software were used for its website, the company also failed to protect customer data and encrypt passwords.  Worse still, the data breach happened around five months ago, according to security researcher Troy Hunter, who first reported the breach in a blog post.  The data, which includes customer names, emails and plaintext passwords, has reportedly been put up for sale on underground markets, giving cyber criminals a big lead.  It is this kind of breach that enables cyber criminals to test usernames and passwords against other sites, which is possibly how hackers gained access to thousands of British Gas and Vodafone accounts.  Hunter, who runs an identity theft service called Have I Been Pwned, said he was tipped off about the breach by an anonymous source.  According to Hunter, 000Webhost has never responded to or acknowledged his warnings or contacted affected customers directly.  However, in a notice published on the company's Facebook page on 29 October, 000Webhost said it became aware of the issue on the 27th of October, when it started working to resolve the issue.  The company said the stolen data included usernames, passwords, email addresses, IP addresses and names, but did spell out that the passwords were not encrypted.  \"We are still working 24/7 to identify and eliminate all security flaws,\" said 000Webhost, adding that it had reset all users' passwords and removed \"illegally uploaded\" pages.  000Webhost also advised all customers to change their passwords and use different passwords for other services.  Independent security consultant Graham Cluley described the lack of encryption \"reckless\".  \"One has to assume that words such as hashing, salting and encryption are not in their dictionary,\" he wrote in a blog post.  Salting refers to the process of adding random nonsense to the password text so that even if two users pick the same password, their password representations end up different. Hashing refers to scrambling the salted password cryptographically.","timeline":{"discovery":{"unit":"Months","value":5},"incident":{"year":2015}},"victim":{"country":["US"],"employee_count":"Unknown","industry":"518210","region":["019021"],"state":"AZ","victim_id":"000Webhost"}},{"action":{"hacking":{"variety":["Use of backdoor or C2"],"vector":["Backdoor or C2"]},"malware":{"cve":"CVE-2013-0640,CVE-2013-0641","name":"MiniDuke","notes":"\"Other\" refers to functionality of malware using Twitter to establish C6","variety":["C2","Downloader","Backdoor","Capture stored data","Other","Disable controls","Rootkit"],"vector":["Email attachment"]},"social":{"target":["Unknown"],"variety":["Phishing"],"vector":["Email"]}},"actor":{"external":{"country":["Unknown"],"motive":["Espionage"],"region":["000000"],"variety":["State-affiliated"]}},"asset":{"assets":[{"variety":"U - Desktop"},{"variety":"S - Unknown"},{"variety":"P - Unknown"}]},"attribute":{"confidentiality":{"data":[{"variety":"Internal"},{"variety":"Unknown"},{"variety":"System"},{"variety":"Secrets"}],"data_disclosure":"Yes"},"integrity":{"variety":["Software installation","Modify configuration","Alter behavior"]}},"campaign_id":"0A74F3BC-4844-4D5F-A350-017A9C81B464","discovery_method":"Ext - suspicious traffic","incident_id":"09390A4C-F45F-47D9-AED8-555A58743A34","plus":{"analyst":"kthompson","analyst_notes":"Compiled from public and private info from source","created":"2014-02-17T20:39:14Z","master_id":"09390A4C-F45F-47D9-AED8-555A58743A34","modified":"2014-06-25T20:35:20Z"},"reference":"http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2013/Kaspersky_Lab_Identifies_MiniDuke_a_New_Malicious_Program_Designed_for_Spying_on_Multiple_Government_Entities_and_Institutions_Across_the_World","schema_version":"1.3.1","security_incident":"Confirmed","source_id":"vcdb","summary":"Incident associated with Miniduke campaign.","timeline":{"incident":{"year":2013}},"victim":{"country":["GE"],"employee_count":"Unknown","industry":"922","region":["150151"]}},{"action":{"hacking":{"variety":["Other"],"vector":["Unknown"]}},"actor":{"external":{"country":["Unknown"],"motive":["Fun"],"region":["000000"],"variety":["Unknown"]}},"asset":{"assets":[{"variety":"U - Unknown"}]},"attribute":{"availability":{"variety":["Loss"]},"integrity":{"notes":"Defaced Traffic Sign with funny announcement.","variety":["Modify data"]}},"discovery_method":"Ext - actor disclosure","impact":{"overall_rating":"Unknown"},"incident_id":"093AA315-EBB6-47DB-9533-1FFE795D5BD1","plus":{"analysis_status":"First pass","analyst":"dhylender","created":"2014-05-18T23:15:00Z","github":"2218","master_id":"093AA315-EBB6-47DB-9533-1FFE795D5BD1","modified":"2014-05-18T23:15:00Z","timeline":{"notification":{"day":16,"month":5,"year":2014}}},"reference":"http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Hacked-San-Francisco-Message-Board-Warns-About-Godzilla-Attack-259449961.html?_osource=SocialFlowFB_BAYBrand","schema_version":"1.3.1","security_incident":"Confirmed","source_id":"vcdb","summary":"Someone hacked into an electronic traffic sign on Van Ness Avenue in San Francisco Wednesday, posting alerts that said \"Godzilla Attack\" and \"Turn Back.\"","timeline":{"incident":{"day":16,"month":5,"year":2014}},"victim":{"country":["US"],"employee_count":"1 to 10","industry":"532490","locations_affected":1,"region":["019021"],"state":"CA","victim_id":"Pacific Highway Rentals"}},{"action":{"hacking":{"variety":["Unknown"],"vector":["Web application"]}},"actor":{"external":{"country":["Unknown"],"motive":["Grudge"],"region":["000000"],"variety":["Activist"]}},"asset":{"assets":[{"variety":"S - Web application"}]},"attribute":{"availability":{"variety":["Loss","Interruption"]},"integrity":{"notes":"defacement","variety":["Modify data","Defacement"]}},"discovery_method":"Ext - actor disclosure","impact":{"overall_rating":"Unknown"},"incident_id":"09C0F425-997C-4AC2-9580-7726250C8A2C","plus":{"analysis_status":"First pass","analyst":"dhylender","created":"2014-01-12T16:56:00Z","github":"1300","master_id":"09C0F425-997C-4AC2-9580-7726250C8A2C","modified":"2014-05-18T15:34:56Z","timeline":{"notification":{"day":11,"month":10,"year":2014}}},"reference":"http://www.zdnet.com/mit-website-hacked-by-anonymous-on-anniversary-of-aaron-swartz-suicide-7000025041/","schema_version":"1.3.1","security_incident":"Confirmed","source_id":"vcdb","summary":"On the anniversary of young hacker and digital activist Aaron Swartz's death, Anonymous has re-engaged its Operation Last resort to hack MIT's website, taking over the server for its Cogeneration project.

In a manifesto left on the defaced page, the group demanded reform to the American justice system and what the activists said are threats to the free flow of information.  The lengthy essay largely mirrors previous demands from Anonymous, but this time the group also cited the recent suicide of Reddit co-founder and activist Aaron Swartz as has having \"crossed a line\" for their organization. Swartz was facing up to 35 years in prison on computer fraud charges.  Prosecutors said he had stolen thousands of digital scientific and academic journal articles from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with the goal of disseminating them for free.  Read More: Aaron Swartz' Death Fuels MIT Probe, White House Petition to Oust Prosecutor  Anonymous says Swartz was \"killed because he was forced into playing a game he could not win - a twisted and distorted perversion of justice - a game where the only winning move was not to play.\"  \"There must be a return to proportionality of punishment with respect to actual harm caused,\" it reads, also mentioning recent arrests of Anonymous associates by the FBI.  In their statement, the hackers say they targeted the homepage of the Federal Sentencing Commission for \"symbolic\" reasons.  The group claimed that if their demands were not met they would release a trove of embarrassing internal Justice Department documents to media outlets. Anonymous named the files after Supreme Court justices and provided hyperlinks to them from the defaced page.  As of press time the commission's site had been taken offline but an earlier attempt by CNN to follow the files' links yielded dead-ends, mostly offline sites.  The file names use an \".aes256? suffix, denoting a common encryption protocol. The same system was used to encrypt the Wikileaks Afghan war documents before their release.","timeline":{"containment":{"unit":"Hours"},"discovery":{"unit":"Hours"},"incident":{"day":26,"month":1,"year":2013}},"victim":{"country":["US"],"employee_count":"Small","industry":"922130","locations_affected":1,"region":["021000","019021"],"state":"NE","victim_id":"Federal Sentencing Commission"}},{"action":{"hacking":{"variety":["Unknown"],"vector":["Web application"]}},"actor":{"external":{"country":["Unknown"],"motive":["Fun"],"region":["000000"],"variety":["Unaffiliated"]}},"asset":{"assets":[{"variety":"S - Web application"}]},"attribute":{"confidentiality":{"data":[{"amount":26,"variety":"Credentials"}],"data_disclosure":"Yes","data_total":26,"state":["Unknown"]}},"discovery_method":"Unknown","impact":{"overall_rating":"Unknown"},"incident_id":"0BB1A8C5-9115-46D9-9138-A28EDEA1150E","plus":{"analysis_status":"First pass","analyst":"Splitler","asset":{"total":"No"},"attribute":{"confidentiality":{"credit_monitoring":"U","data_abuse":"Y"}},"created":"2013-07-02T20:34:03Z","f500":"N","master_id":"0BB1A8C5-9115-46D9-9138-A28EDEA1150E","modified":"2014-05-10T00:58:18Z","timeline":{"notification":{"day":28,"month":6,"year":2013}}},"reference":"http://www.cyberwarnews.info/2013/05/28/interactive-data-hacked-data-leaked-by-teamberserk/","schema_version":"1.3.1","security_incident":"Confirmed","source_id":"vcdb","summary":"Website breach leads to 32 user accounts posted on public site.","timeline":{"compromise":{"unit":"Unknown"},"containment":{"unit":"Unknown"},"discovery":{"unit":"Unknown"},"exfiltration":{"unit":"Unknown"},"incident":{"month":6,"year":2013}},"victim":{"country":["US"],"employee_count":"1001 to 10000","industry":"51919","region":["019021"],"revenue":{"amount":880000000,"iso_currency_code":"USD"},"state":"MA","victim_id":"Interactive Data"}},{"action":{"hacking":{"variety":["Unknown"],"vector":["Web application"]}},"actor":{"external":{"country":["Unknown","US"],"motive":["Unknown","Espionage"],"region":["000000","019021"],"variety":["Competitor"]}},"asset":{"assets":[{"variety":"S - Web application"}]},"attribute":{"confidentiality":{"data":[{"amount":33000,"variety":"Internal"}],"data_disclosure":"Yes","data_total":33000,"data_victim":["Customer"],"state":["Stored"]}},"discovery_method":"Unknown","impact":{"overall_rating":"Unknown"},"incident_id":"0BD7E887-EF6E-4774-ABB8-91D58D1ABEBB","plus":{"analysis_status":"Finalized","analyst":"DaveyBaby","attribute":{"confidentiality":{"credit_monitoring":"U"}},"created":"2016-09-13T18:19:00Z","dbir_year":2016,"github":"6085","master_id":"0BD7E887-EF6E-4774-ABB8-91D58D1ABEBB","modified":"2016-09-13T18:19:00Z","sub_source":"PHIDBR","timeline":{"notification":{"day":1,"month":7,"year":2015}}},"reference":"http://www.courthousenews.com/2015/07/01/major-workers-comp-insurers-hacked-legal-files-class-claims.htm","schema_version":"1.3","security_incident":"Confirmed","source_id":"vcdb","summary":"Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies, Cypress Insurance and Zenith Insurance.
